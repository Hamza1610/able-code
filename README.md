# üåü **STEM Education Platform for Children with Disabilities** üåü

### **An Accessible and Interactive Learning Platform**  
This project is designed to help children with disabilities learn STEM subjects (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics). It integrates accessibility tools like **voice commands**, interpreters, and interactive educational modules to create an inclusive learning environment.

---

## üéØ **Project Overview**

Our mission is to provide a platform that makes STEM education accessible and enjoyable for children with disabilities. The web app includes:

1. **Voice Commands**: Control the app using voice for easier navigation.  
2. **Interactive Modules**: Explore coding (Python), physics simulations (PHET), and creative tools (Scratch).  
3. **Accessibility Features**: Text-to-Speech, speech recognition, and visual enhancements.  
4. **Basic Authentication**: Secure user login and sign-up using Firebase.  
5. **Python Code Interpreter**: Allows children to write and execute basic Python code directly in the browser.

## üåê **Features**

- **Landing Page**: A simple, user-friendly entry point with intuitive navigation.
- **Python Interpreter**: A built-in code editor to learn and execute Python scripts.
- **PHET Simulation**: Embedded physics simulation tools for hands-on learning.
- **Scratch Integration**: Visual programming for creative exploration.
- **Voice Command Support**: Users can:
   - Navigate between pages.
   - Interact with app elements.
   - Receive voice responses for better accessibility.
- **Authentication**: User registration, login, and session management using **Firebase SDK**.
- **Text-to-Speech**: Converts generated or selected content into voice for children with visual impairments.
- **Responsive UI**: Designed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for accessibility across devices.
